# Competitive_coding
**Competitive Coding Concepts Practice Repository**
This repository contains a collection of competitive coding questions based on various concepts. These questions were allocated to us as part of our curriculum during the 6th semester of our B.Tech program. The questions cover topics such as circular array rotation, k-jagged numbers, St√∂rmer numbers, p-smooth numbers, the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), and finding the subarray sum.
**Purpose**
The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of challenging coding exercises to enhance our problem-solving skills and strengthen our understanding of competitive coding concepts. By working through these questions, we can improve our algorithmic thinking, learn different approaches to problem-solving, and gain confidence in tackling coding challenges.
Enjoy the journey of competitive coding and keep honing your problem-solving skills!
